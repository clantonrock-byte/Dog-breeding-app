BP Dog List Photo Open Patch

What it does:
- In the Dogs list, adds a small photo placeholder on each dog card.
- Tapping the photo/placeholder triggers the existing profile open action.
- Hides the old 'Open' button (to encourage the new UX).

Install:
1) Upload dog_photo_open.js to your repo root.
2) Add this line near the bottom of your root index.html before </body>:
   <script src="dog_photo_open.js"></script>

No other changes required. This is non-invasive and preserves your baseline behavior.
