BP Portal v1

What this is:
- A simple web portal/dashboard for your BP app (MASTER-LOCKED nav-35+).
- Reads localStorage from the same origin (same GitHub Pages domain).
- Shows Dogs, Inventory (Edible), Stock (Inedible), and History.

How to deploy (recommended):
- Upload the /portal folder into your repo root.
- Access at: https://<your_pages_domain>/Dog-breeding-app/portal/

Notes:
- If you host the portal on a different domain, it will NOT share localStorage.
- Export/Import allows moving a snapshot between devices.
