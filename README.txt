# BP Photo Debug Pack

This zip contains:
- rc_photo_diag.js  → Diagnoses where dog photos are coming from
- disable_list_photos.js → Temporarily disables photos in dog list (safety)

How to use:
1. Upload rc_photo_diag.js to repo root and open it in browser to see alert.
2. If dogs all share same photo, it's a data issue.
3. Optionally include disable_list_photos.js AFTER app.js to stop list photo bleed.

This pack does NOT delete data.
