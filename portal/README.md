Dog Profile Toggle UI (Stabilized)

This package replaces dropdowns with segmented toggle controls for:
- Sex (Male/Female)
- Reproductive status (Intact → Fixed)
- Life stage (Puppy → Adult)
- Disposition (Active, For Sale, Transferred, Deceased, Retired)

All transitions are one-way where biologically required.
Designed to prevent state leakage and persistence conflicts.
