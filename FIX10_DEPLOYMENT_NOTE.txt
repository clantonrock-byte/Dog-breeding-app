IMPORTANT NOTE – GitHub Pages Cache / FIX10

This repository DOES contain FIX10 in index.html.
If the live site still shows FIX08, the cause is GitHub Pages caching or delayed redeploy.

WHAT TO DO:
1) Verify FIX10 is present:
   - Open index.html in the repo
   - Tap “Raw”
   - You should see FIX10 in the file

2) Force GitHub Pages redeploy:
   - Edit build.json (or any small file)
   - Change a value slightly (example: fix10 → fix10b)
   - Commit the change

3) Open the site with a hard cache buster:
   https://clantonrock-byte.github.io/Dog-breeding-app/?v=10&cb=12345

NOTES:
- Incognito mode may hide browser options; this is expected.
- GitHub Pages sometimes lags after updates.
- This is a deployment issue, not an app logic issue.

STATUS:
- Add Dog works
- Buttons are wired
- Dark mode implemented in FIX10
